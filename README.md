# Library Manager

An easy-to-use app called Library Manager assists book lovers in managing their library and future purchases and reading plans. The user can view the list of books in three different ways: Library, Wishlist, and Queue, or they can simply add a new book using a special form. The fact that a single item can be moved between segments in an ordered manner makes the program simple to use. You can swipe a book that has already been purchased into the reading queue, mark a queued book as read, or simply move a book from your wishlist and put it in your library.

## Technical Details

I was motivated to make this application so that I could practice **SwiftUI** and gain more familiarity with **The Composable Architecture**. **TCA** enables developers to create screens more quickly and test them more simply. 

Users can sync lists as long as the app is installed on their device because I picked CoreData as a persistent layer.

## Demo

When the app is launched for the first time, your library starts empty. To see the full experience, you can load a predefined list of books. Simply search the **shouldFetchPredefinedList** property in the project and set its value as needed.
